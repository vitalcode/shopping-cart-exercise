# HMRC Shopping Cart Exercise

## Step 1: Shopping cart

Checkout system for a shop which only sells apples and oranges.
* Apples cost 60p and oranges cost 25p.
* Build a checkout system which takes a list of items scanned at the till and outputs
the total cost
* For example: [ Apple, Apple, Orange, Apple ] => Â£2.05
* Make reasonable assumptions about the inputs to your solution; for example, many
candidates take a list of strings as input

## Step 2: Simple offers

* The shop decides to introduce two new offers
    * buy one, get one free on Apples
    * 3 for the price of 2 on Oranges
* Update your checkout functions accordingly
